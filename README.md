# Word Reversal Using Stack

This C++ program reverses the words in a given sentence by utilizing a stack data structure. It splits the sentence into individual words and prints them in reverse order.

## Features

- **Word Splitting**: Splits a sentence into words based on spaces.
- **Stack Utilization**: Uses a stack to store words temporarily, enabling reversal.

## Usage

1. **Input Expression**:
   - The program processes a predefined sentence (e.g., `"Hello this is data structures"`).

2. **Word Reversal**:
   - Each word is pushed onto the stack as the program iterates through the sentence.
   - After all words are pushed, they are popped from the stack to print them in reverse order.

3. **Output**:
   - The reversed words are displayed as a single line.

### Example

In the given code:

- The sentence `"Hello this is data structures"` is reversed to `"structures data is this Hello "`.

**Output**:
```plaintext
structures data is this Hello
